# obMenu

A tiny WYSIWYG-style Markdown formatting layer for Obsidian users.

obMenu is a clean-room Obsidian Markdown toolbar inspired by cMenu. It gives the editor a mini WYSIWYG-style layer for common formatting while keeping your notes as plain Markdown underneath. Headings, checkboxes, callouts, links, highlights, code, lists, bold, italic, and a few quiet helpers stay right next to the text you are writing.

Keep it pinned at the bottom. Let it follow the selection. Drag it somewhere comfortable and leave it there. You still write Markdown, just with fewer command palette trips, fewer memorized shortcuts, and a little more direct manipulation.

> Status: GitHub-release ready. Community plugin submission: in progress.

## What works now

### Markdown actions

The built-in command registry covers:

- Bold
- Italic
- Strikethrough
- Underline
- Highlight
- Clear formatting
- Inline code
- Code block
- Block quote
- Callout
- Checkbox
- Bulleted list
- Numbered list
- Markdown link
- Wikilink
- Headings H1-H6

The default toolbar doesn't show every command at once. It starts with a useful writing set and leaves the rest available through presets or the settings tab.

### Headings

The default toolbar shows H1, H2, H3, and H4 as separate buttons. H5, H6, and the grouped heading menu are still there if you want a different setup.

### Toolbar placement

obMenu has four placement modes:

- `fixed`: keep the toolbar at the bottom of the workspace.
- `selection`: show it near selected text.
- `cursor`: place it near the current editor selection or caret when the browser gives obMenu a usable selection rectangle.
- `manual`: drag it by the handle and keep the saved position.

Selection, cursor, and manual placement stay inside the viewport, even in small windows.

### Toolbar customization

The toolbar is editable from settings:

- Add any built-in command that isn't already on the toolbar.
- Remove buttons you don't use.
- Add visual separators between groups.
- Reorder buttons with drag and drop.
- Reorder buttons with arrow controls if drag and drop is awkward.
- Reset the toolbar back to the default set.

Separators are real toolbar items, so you can make the bar read like groups instead of one long strip of icons.

### Presets

Presets are quick starting points:

- `Writer`: the full default set for regular Markdown writing.
- `Zettelkasten`: headings, checkboxes, quotes, highlights, wikilinks, and Markdown links.
- `Code notes`: inline code, code blocks, lists, callouts, and links.
- `Compact`: a shorter toolbar with grouped headings and the compact visual style.

After picking a preset, you can still add buttons, remove buttons, add separators, and reorder everything. Presets don't lock the toolbar. They just save you from building the first version by hand.

### Styles

- `default`: regular Obsidian toolbar density.
- `compact`: smaller buttons when the note needs more room.

Both styles use Obsidian theme variables, so obMenu follows light and dark themes without adding its own color system.

### Editing details

- Toolbar actions return focus to the active Markdown editor.
- Empty inline-format actions put the cursor between the inserted markers.
- Selecting already wrapped text and pressing the same inline action removes the wrapper.
- Checkbox toggling preserves indentation and handles empty checked or unchecked task items.
- Callout toggling turns the current line into `> [!note]`, or removes an existing callout marker.
- Clear formatting removes common inline wrappers from the selection or current line.

### Settings safety

Saved settings are normalized on load. If old or malformed data shows up, obMenu falls back to defaults instead of breaking the toolbar.

### Release support

The repo has a local release build and a tag-based GitHub release workflow. Release assets include `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`, with GitHub artifact attestations.

## Settings

The settings tab lets you:

- Turn the toolbar on or off.
- Choose the placement mode.
- Choose the visual style.
- Reset the manual toolbar position.
- Apply toolbar presets: Writer, Zettelkasten, Code notes, and Compact.
- Add built-in toolbar buttons.
- Add visual separators.
- Reorder toolbar buttons with drag and drop or arrow buttons.
- Remove toolbar buttons.
- Reset toolbar items to the default set.

## Install from GitHub release

Download these files from the latest GitHub release:

```text
main.js
manifest.json
styles.css
```

Put them here in your vault:

```text
.obsidian/plugins/obmenu
```

Then enable `obMenu` from Obsidian's community plugin settings.

## Build locally

Build the release folder:

```bash
npm run build:dist
```

Copy this folder:

```text
dist/obmenu
```

to your vault:

```text
.obsidian/plugins/obmenu
```

Then enable `obMenu` from Obsidian's community plugin settings.

## Release files

`npm run build:dist` creates:

```text
dist/obmenu/main.js
dist/obmenu/manifest.json
dist/obmenu/styles.css
dist/obmenu/LICENSE
```

`dist/` is ignored by Git. Rebuild it when you need a fresh local package.

## Release workflow

GitHub releases are created from semver tags without a `v` prefix:

```bash
git tag 0.1.0
git push origin 0.1.0
```

The release workflow runs on tags matching `x.y.z`. It installs dependencies with `npm ci`, runs `npm audit --omit=dev`, typechecks, runs tests, builds `dist/obmenu`, checks that the tag matches `package.json` and `manifest.json`, verifies release assets, creates GitHub artifact attestations, and publishes `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run TypeScript checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Build the root plugin bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the release folder:

```bash
npm run build:dist
```

Run the full pre-release check:

```bash
npm run check
```

`npm run check` runs tests, the production build, the release folder build, and `npm audit --omit=dev`.

## Test coverage

The current tests cover:

- Settings normalization.
- Markdown transforms.
- H1-H6 heading application.
- Checkbox edge cases.
- Callout and clear-formatting transforms.
- Toolbar command registry.
- Contextual toolbar positioning.

## Roadmap

Next up:

- UI for adding and removing custom Obsidian commands.
- Better cursor geometry when Obsidian exposes a stable editor-coordinate API.
- Manual smoke-test notes for common Obsidian themes and vault layouts.

## Privacy

obMenu runs locally inside Obsidian. It doesn't send notes, selections, settings, or telemetry anywhere.

## Inspiration

obMenu is inspired by cMenu, an earlier Obsidian formatting toolbar plugin. This project doesn't copy cMenu source files.
